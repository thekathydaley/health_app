# health_app
I used JavaScript and React to build this health app. 

The purpose of this app is to help guide a healthy lifestyle by providing a calorie counter, random exercise generator, as well as a recipe search to prepare food at home which can help eliminate increased caloric intake.

I can across a few issues with the functions but overcame them. 
I used the Edamam API to generate my recipe cards
My app is deployed here:

My components are separated into my separate pages for clarity sake:
Calories
CSS
Exercise
Recipes

Each file has at least two components.
